# Bloch simulations

This course is inspired and based on [RAD229](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNpILrLUvKs) letures from Stanford.

# Scripts


This module contains several scripts that demonstrate the application of 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on images and the effect of gradients on spin dephasing.

Scripts included:

- app_fft_image.py: A Tkinter application that applies FFT on images.
- app_fft_spins.py: A PyQT5 application that visualizes how gradients are applied to spins.
- fft_1d_example.py: A simple script that visualizes the use of 1D FFT.
- show_fft_example.py: A simple script that demonstrates the purpose and application of FFT.

These scripts are helpful for understanding the practical applications of FFT in image processing and spin dynamics.
